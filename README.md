This code was used in the design of a category learning task.
Participants have to discern whether terrain seen in video clips 
is type A, B, or C with only 'correct' vs. 'incorrect' feedback.
They are not told that the terrain videos vary on 4 dimensions:
hilliness, vegetation thickness, light vs. dark sky, and weather intensity (wind).
The goal of this pilot study was to create a learning task with a level of difficulty
and complexity optimal for eliciting implicit learning, where participants improve
without being aware of learned rules, instead simply going on 'gut instinct'. 
To design the study, we had to create 3 clusters of category exemplars optimally placed 
within the four-dimensional feature space. This script iteratively generates coordinates
for sets of clusters and allows selection based on things such as whether all of the 
dimensions are equally relevant to responding correctly.
